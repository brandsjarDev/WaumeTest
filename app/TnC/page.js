              Product descriptions contained in the online shop do not represent
              binding offers from WAUME, but merely serve as a basis for
              customers to make a binding offer. Customers have the opportunity
              to submit offers via the online shop. If the customer places goods
              and/or services in the shopping cart and goes through the
              electronic ordering process, he or she submits a legally binding
              contractual offer regarding the goods and/or services contained in
              the shopping cart by clicking on the “Order for a fee” order
              button.
