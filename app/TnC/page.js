              customers to make a binding offer. Customers have the opportunity
              to submit offers via the online shop. If the customer places goods
              and/or services in the shopping cart and goes through the

              is sent by the customer and ends at the end of the fifth following
              working day. If WAUME does not accept it on time, the offer is
              deemed not to have been accepted after the deadline has expired.

              another agreement has been made. The purchase on account payment
              method requires a successful credit check by Klarna AB. If the
              customer is granted the payment method of purchase on account
              after checking the creditworthiness, the payment is processed in
              cooperation with Klarna AB, to which WAUME assigns the payment
              claim. In this case, the customer can only pay to Klarna AB to
              discharge the debt. Klarna AB's general terms and conditions

              exceptions) for goods that are manufactured according to customer
              specifications or are clearly tailored to personal needs, such as

              For non-customized products, consumers have the right to cancel
              contracts within 14 days without giving reasons. The deadline for
              cancellation is 14 days from the day on which the consumer or a
              third party designated by him who is not the carrier received the
              last goods in an order. In the case of a contract for the regular
              delivery of goods over a specified period, the cancellation period
              is 14 days from the day on which the consumer or a third party
              designated by you, other than the carrier, took delivery of the
              first goods have or has. In order to exercise the right of
              withdrawal, the consumer is obliged to inform WAUME of the
              decision to withdraw from the contract by a clear statement (e.g.
              a letter sent by post or email). For an example sample

              In the event of a timely withdrawal regarding goods that can be
              withdrawn, we are obliged to reimburse consumers for all payments
              that we have received from the consumer, including delivery costs

              consumer choosing a type of delivery other than that of have

              and at the latest within 14 days from the day on which we received
              notification of the cancellation of this contract. For this
              refund, we use the same payment method that was used in the
              original transaction, unless expressly agreed otherwise with the
              consumer; In no case will consumers be charged any fees for this
              reimbursement. We may refuse the refund until we have received the
              goods back or until the consumer has provided evidence that the
              goods have been returned, whichever is the earlier. The goods must
              be returned or handed over to us immediately and in any case
              within fourteen days from the day on which the consumer informs us
              of the cancellation of this contract. The deadline is deemed to
              have been met if the goods are dispatched before the expiry of the
              fourteen day period. The direct costs of returning the goods are
              the responsibility of the consumer. The risk of a possible loss in
              value of the goods must be borne by the consumer if this loss in
              value is due to improper handling by the consumer.

              its management, employees, representatives and vicarious agents
              from all claims, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses,
              including reasonable legal fees and court costs, arising from or
              in connection with the use of the Products or services offered by
              WAUME, a violation of these General Terms and Conditions or a
              violation of third party rights, in particular copyright,
              trademark, patent or other intellectual property rights or
              personal rights. In this case, the customer also bears the
              reasonable costs for the necessary legal defense, including all
              statutory court and legal fees. In the event of a claim by third
              parties, the customer is obliged to provide WAUME immediately,
              truthfully and completely with all information necessary for the
              examination of the claims and a defense.

              The exemption from liability also includes the event that the
              customer uses the products supplied by WAUME improperly or does
              not follow the application recommendations and instructions and
              this causes damage or injuries.

              The exemption from liability does not apply to damages that are
              based on intent or gross negligence on the part of WAUME, its
              management, employees, representatives or vicarious agents or for
              damages that arise due to injury to life, body or health.
              Liability for breaches of essential contractual obligations also

              WAUME may occasionally offer vouchers and discount codes that are
              valid for purchasing products and services in the online shop.
              Vouchers and discount codes may be temporary and their validity
              may be limited to certain products, services, or order values.
              Vouchers and discount codes cannot be redeemed in combination with
              each other, in combination with themselves, or with other offers
              or promotions from WAUME, unless expressly stated otherwise.
              Vouchers and discount codes are only valid for the specified
              period and can only be redeemed once as part of an ordering
              process.
            </li>
            <li>
              Vouchers and discount codes must be entered and confirmed in the
              designated field in the shopping cart before completing the
              ordering process. It is not possible to subsequently offset or
              credit vouchers or discount codes to an order that has already
              been completed.

            <li>
              Discount vouchers and discount codes are not transferable and can
              only be redeemed by the designated recipient. A cash payment or
              the exchange of vouchers and discount codes for other goods or
              services is not possible.

              code, WAUME reserves the right to declare the corresponding
              discount or discount code invalid and to charge the original
              prices for the products or services ordered.
            </li>

              WAUME reserves the right to change the conditions for redeeming

              without prior notice. There is no entitlement to the availability
              or receipt of vouchers or discount codes. If goods that were
              ordered using a discount code are returned, there will be no
              refund of the amount deducted.

            <li>
              If a customer provides the name or corresponding code of an
              intermediary when placing an order, the intermediary receives a
              commission for this order. The amount of the commission is
              determined by WAUME and communicated to the agent in advance.
            </li>
            <li>
              The intermediary commission is granted for each delivery to the
              customer under an existing subscription, as long as the
              subscription is active and the customer has placed the order
              specifying the intermediary's name or code.
            </li>
            <li>
              The agent commission is paid out every quarter or in another
              period specified by WAUME. WAUME reserves the right to change the
              payment modalities at its own discretion and taking into account
              the legal provisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              The agent is obliged to provide all necessary information and
              documents to ensure the proper payment of the commission. This
              includes, but is not limited to, providing correct bank details
              and fulfilling all tax obligations related to maintaining the
              commission.

            <li>
              WAUME reserves the right to withhold or reclaim the agent's
              commission if the customer cancels, returns, or does not pay for
              the ordered products, or if the agent violates WAUME's terms and
              conditions or acts contrary to applicable law.

            <li>
              The intermediary is responsible for complying with all legal
              requirements and regulatory requirements in connection with its
              intermediary activity, including registering a business,
              fulfilling tax obligations, and complying with other relevant

              tax liabilities arising from the agent activity.
            </li>
            <li>
              The intermediary confirms that he has the necessary legal
              requirements to carry out the intermediary activity and will

              no longer able to continue the intermediary activity.

            <li>
              The agent is liable for all damages incurred by WAUME as a result
              of failure to comply with these responsibilities. The agent
              undertakes to indemnify WAUME from any third-party claims asserted
              due to non-compliance with these responsibilities.

              WAUME is solely obliged to pay the commissions earned to the

              addition, WAUME assumes no further obligations or liabilities in

              If the customer operates as an entrepreneur, all legal
              relationships between the parties are subject to the law of the
              country in which WAUME has its registered office. The UN
              Convention on the International Sale of Goods does not apply. The
              exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this
              contract is WAUME's registered office.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the customer acts as a consumer, all legal relationships
              between the parties are subject to the law of the country in which
              the customer has his habitual residence. The exclusive place of
              jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this contract is the
              customer's place of residence.
            </li>

              The customer is not entitled to assign or transfer claims or

              Should individual provisions of these General Terms and Conditions
              be or become wholly or partially invalid or unenforceable, this
              will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. Instead
              of the invalid or unenforceable provision, an effective and
              enforceable provision that comes closest to the economic purpose
              of the ineffective or unenforceable provision is deemed to have
              been agreed. The same applies in the event that a gap in the
              regulations turns out to be in these general terms and conditions.
              The contracting parties undertake to replace the ineffective,
              unenforceable or incomplete provision with an appropriate
              provision that corresponds to the economic purpose of the original
              provision and does not jeopardize the purpose of the contract.
